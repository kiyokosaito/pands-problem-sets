# pands-problem-sets

This is my attempt to tackle problem sets 2019

Q1: I watched lecture videos so many times and mimic the code from A first Python program on 1/23/2019. I checked the the result by calculating manually and I know that this is not the cool way to code but this is the best I can do right now.

Q2: I figured out from the lecture video "Run a Python program" 1/18/2019 that if Tuesday is 1, Wednesday is 2 and Thursday is 3 so I basically copied and pasted the code from the video and modify it to be able to run for Tuesday and Thursday (1 and 3).

# pands-problem-sets

This is my attempt to tackle problem sets 2019

Q1: I watched lecture videos so many times and mimic the code from A first Python program on 1/23/2019. I checked the the result by calculating manually and I know that this is not the cool way to code but this is the best I can do right now.

Q2: I figured out from the lecture video "Run a Python program" 1/18/2019 that if Tuesday is 1, Wednesday is 2 and Thursday is 3 so I basically copied and pasted the code from the video and modify it to be able to run for Tuesday and Thursday (1 and 3). 

Q3: I googled the question as it is written. Then I got the link below :
https://github.com/komuw/odesk-elance-python-answers/blob/master/question5-numbers%20divisible%20by%207%20but%20are%20not%20multiples%20of%205.py

Then found this link : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-print-numbers-divisible-3-5-given-number/ . I copied the code from the first link then modified accoring to the second link. 

I searched python tutorial in my language (Japanese) : https://note.nkmk.me/python-if-elif-else/ and decided this is the final solution for Q3.And I checked the results mannually by calculating by 6 and 12. 

Q4: I think this solution needs while and loop function.

Q5: Using If and Else statement to determin if the integer is prime number or not. I googled it and took codes from  https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/prime-number and edited the prints.

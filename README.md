# pands-problem-sets

This is my attempt to tackle problem sets 2019

Q1: I watched lecture videos so many times and mimic the code from A first Python program on 1/23/2019. I checked the the result by calculating manually and I know that this is not the cool way to code but this is the best I can do right now.

Q2: I figured out from the lecture video "Run a Python program" 1/18/2019 that if Tuesday is 1, Wednesday is 2 and Thursday is 3 so I basically copied and pasted the code from the video and modify it to be able to run for Tuesday and Thursday (1 and 3). 

Q3: I googled the question as it is written. Then I got the link below :
https://github.com/komuw/odesk-elance-python-answers/blob/master/question5-numbers%20divisible%20by%207%20but%20are%20not%20multiples%20of%205.py

Then found this link : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-print-numbers-divisible-3-5-given-number/ . I copied the code from the first link then modified accoring to the second link. 

I searched python tutorial in my language (Japanese) : https://note.nkmk.me/python-if-elif-else/ and decided this is the final solution for Q3.And I checked the results mannually by calculating by 6 and 12. 

Q4: I think this solution needs while and loop function. I just cannot figure this out so I googled how to write collatz and took the code from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33508034/making-a-collatz-program-automate-the-boring-stuff .I got the while and loop needs to be used but I still do not figured out how to use them...

Q5: Using If and Else statement to determin if the integer is prime number or not. I googled it and took codes from  https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/prime-number and edited the prints.

Q6: Watched the video again (few times now) fstring and string operation from Week 7, referred python tutorial standard libraly. use input format from Q1 and Q5, googled "how to print every second words from sentence" @ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17645327/python-3-3-how-to-grab-every-5th-word-in-a-text-file and mimic the code that martineau answered the thread on Jul 15 '13 at 1:07. Tested and worked.  

Q8:from python Tutorial datetime â€” Basic date and time types:https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html?highlight=date%20time#datetime.datetime.time , I can see that class datetime.datetime is needed for the solution for this question. Also I refered this link : https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/current-datetime but I could not make to pring date in English format. (24th March 22:34
